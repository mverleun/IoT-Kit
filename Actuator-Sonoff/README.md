# Actuator-Sonoff

This firmware is meant to be used on a Sonoff S20 switch. It's part of the [IoT Kit for education](https://www.iot-kit.nl) project.

It serves as an actuator that can switch a light on and off via MQTT.

The Sonoff S20 also has a button that can be used to switch a light on and off and the status of the button is also reported via MQTT.

Allmost all code is from: https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266/blob/develop/examples/IteadSonoffButton/IteadSonoffButton.ino
