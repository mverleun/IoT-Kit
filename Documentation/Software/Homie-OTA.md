# Homie OTA
[homie-ota](https://github.com/jpmens/homie-ota) which is developed by JP Mens is used as a management solution. It is easy to use and has a lot of functionallity. We use it to change firmware on the devices remotely, but it also shows sensor readings and the status of the device. It is invaluable in the total setup.
