# IoT for education

In education you want focus on learning objectivs and not be distracted by avoidable side effects.

So no breadboars with loose or misplaced wires. No expensive solutions like Grove Pi, but a robust collection of controllers and affordable hardware.

Some sort of standarisation is required as well, as is flexibility.

The [homie convention](https://github.com/homieiot/convention) establishes a standard and is rapidly addopted as such.

The homie convention is available for ESP8266 based devices, but also as a Python framework. It avoids a lot of coding which results in clean firmwares that are easy to understand, even for novice students.
